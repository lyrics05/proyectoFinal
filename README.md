# Henry's Bootcamp Final Project - E-commerce
Welcome to our final project for Henry's Bootcamp! Our team has created an E-commerce platform where users can buy and sell cars. Whether you're a car enthusiast looking for your dream ride or a seller looking to reach a wider audience, our platform has got you covered.

We've utilized a wide range of cutting-edge technologies to bring this project to life. Our front-end is built with React, Redux, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. On the back-end, we're using Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, Auth0, and Mercadopago for payment processing. We've also used Git for version control, Railway for database hosting, and Vercel for deployment. To create a modern, sleek design, we've leveraged the power of TailwindCSS.

Our platform features intuitive search and filtering options, so users can quickly find the car of their dreams. Sellers can easily create and manage listings, with features like image uploads and detailed descriptions. And thanks to our integration with Mercadopago, buyers can securely and easily make payments directly on our platform.

We're incredibly proud of what we've accomplished with this project and hope you enjoy exploring our platform!
